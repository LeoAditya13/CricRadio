# CricRadio Spotlight Card Algorithm

#Overview
This project implements a Spotlight Card Algorithm for CricRadio, a cricket-based application, to maximize user engagement by showcasing the most relevant and exciting cricket matches. The algorithm calculates the TRP (Television Rating Points) priority for each match by considering various priority parameters, ensuring that users are presented with the most engaging and trending matches in real-time.

#Problem Statement
CricRadio displays a variety of cricket matches, including live, upcoming, and completed games, to its users. To enhance user experience, it's crucial to strategically prioritize and highlight matches that are likely to generate higher interest. This involves assessing multiple factors like the match type, rivalry, teams involved, timing, series significance, and more. By developing a comprehensive algorithm that accounts for these parameters, the application aims to spotlight the most relevant matches, thereby retaining users' attention for longer periods.

#Solution Approach
The solution involves creating an algorithm that computes a TRP priority score for each match based on several parameters and weights. The score determines the match's relevance, which is then used to rank matches. The algorithm is implemented in Python, leveraging the Pandas library to process and manipulate the data. It reads data from an Excel sheet containing match information and outputs a prioritized list based on the TRP score.

#Input Data
The input data is provided in an Excel sheet that includes critical information about cricket matches. The relevant columns are:

Match No.: Unique identifier for the match.
Date: The scheduled date of the match.
Time (IST): The start time of the match in Indian Standard Time.
Team A and Team B: Teams playing the match.
Location: The venue where the match is held.
League/Event: Type of league or event, such as World Cup or IPL.
Rivalry: Key rivalries, such as India vs. Pakistan.
Series Type: The type of series, like World Cup or bilateral series.
No. of Teams: Total teams participating in the series.
Match Type: Format of the match (T20, ODI, Test).
Match Category: International or Domestic.
Gender: Indicates if the match is Men's or Women's cricket.
Finish Time (IST): Time when the match concludes.

#1. Combining Priority Parameters to Determine the TRP Priority
The TRP priority is determined by combining several parameters, each contributing a specific weight to the overall score:

Series Type: Matches from the World Cup have higher priority.
Rivalry: Key rivalries like India vs. Pakistan or Ashes (England vs. Australia) are given precedence.
Status: Live matches are given the highest priority, followed by upcoming and completed matches.
Teams: Matches involving popular teams like India, Australia, and England have higher weights.
Time (IST) - Start Time: Matches scheduled during prime time slots (e.g., 1700-2030 hrs IST) are prioritized.
Match Category: International matches are given precedence over domestic matches.
Format: T20 matches generally have a higher viewership, followed by ODIs and Tests.
Is League: Matches that are part of a league are considered more engaging.
No. of Teams in Series: Series with more teams involved are considered more competitive and engaging.
Gender: Men's matches typically have a higher weight, but women's matches are also considered.
Each parameter is assigned a weight based on its significance, and the total TRP score is computed by summing up the weights. The final prioritized list is generated by sorting matches based on the computed TRP scores.

#2. Assumptions or Simplifications Made
Default Weights: If a parameter is missing or has invalid data, a default weight is assigned. For example, if the start time is missing, it defaults to the lowest priority weight.
Rivalry and Teams: If rivalry information is not specified or does not match predefined key rivalries, a default weight is applied.
Status Mapping: The "League/Event" field is used to infer the status (Live, Upcoming, Completed, etc.), assuming standard formats in the input data.
Handling NaN Values: The code checks for NaN or invalid values in critical fields to avoid errors during calculation.

#3. Handling Edge Cases or Conflicting Priorities
Invalid or Missing Data: The algorithm checks for missing or NaN values for critical fields and assigns default weights to avoid breaking the calculation process.
Conflicting Priorities: In cases where multiple parameters could have conflicting impacts (e.g., a high-priority team in a low-priority time slot), the TRP score is balanced by considering the weights of all parameters. This ensures that no single parameter disproportionately influences the final score.
Completed Matches Displayed Only for 4 Hours: Completed matches are filtered based on the finish time and are only displayed for a minimum of 4 hours during daytime (8 AM - 8 PM IST).

#Algorithm and Implementation
The algorithm is implemented in Python using the following steps:
Data Loading: The input Excel file is read using the Pandas library.
Data Cleaning: Handles missing or NaN values, ensuring all necessary fields are processed correctly.
TRP Calculation: For each row (match), a TRP priority score is calculated based on the above parameters. Each parameter is assigned a weight, and the total score is computed.
Sorting and Filtering: Matches are sorted based on the calculated TRP score to display the most relevant matches first.
Output: The prioritized list of matches is displayed or saved, ready to be shown in the Spotlight section of the CricRadio app.

#Results and Benefits
The Spotlight Card algorithm significantly enhances user engagement by ensuring that the most relevant and trending matches are highlighted in real-time. 
By factoring in various aspects such as series significance, team popularity, rivalry, and match timing, the algorithm ensures that CricRadio users are always up-to-date with the most exciting cricket action.

#Conclusion
The implementation of the Spotlight Card algorithm in CricRadio demonstrates the importance of data-driven decision-making in enhancing user experience. 
By leveraging match data and intelligently prioritizing content, the application can effectively capture user interest, leading to higher retention and satisfaction rates.
